## Dask

* Display head of the dataframe ❌ 
* Display number of rows of this dataframe. ❌ 
* Compute the total number of passengers. ❌ 
* Count occurrences in the payment_type column both for the full dataset, and filtered by zero tip (tip_amount == 0). ❌ 
* Create a new column, tip_fraction ❌ 
* Plot the average of the new column tip_fraction grouped by day of week. ❌ 
* Plot the average of the new column tip_fraction grouped by hour of day. ❌ 

## Spark 

* Plot the tip as a function of the hour of day and the day of the week ? ▶️
* Investigate the `payment_type` column.  See how well each of the payment types correlate with the `tip_fraction`.  Did you find anything interesting?
  Any guesses on what the different payment types might be?  If you're interested you may be able to find more information on the [NYC TLC's website](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) ❌
* How quickly can you get a taxi cab for a particular day of the year?  How about for a particular hour of that day? ❌
